### basespace-smalt

#### Description
basespace-smalt sets up an alignment pipeline inside a Docker container, that can be uploaded as a Illumina Basespace Native App. The alignment is performed by smalt. The resulting bam file is post-processed by bamsort, bamstreamingmarkduplicates and samtools flagstat / stats. An index file, md5 as well as flagstat plots are generated.

#### Quick Start Instructions: Get it running on BaseSpace

##### Setup account and dev environment
0. Install Docker
1. Create [Dev Account](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/)
2. Create [Native App](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/apps/new)
3. (For local testing): Install the [SpaceDock VM](https://developer.basespace.illumina.com/docs/content/documentation/native-apps/setup-dev-environment#Instructions_for_Mac_or_Linux)

##### Build image and push it to Basespace

# Use your BaseSpace credentials when prompted for username, password, and email
sudo docker login docker.illumina.com

# Build Image from Dockerfile
